This project reads through a `.txt` file and extracts all unique email addresses using Python's `re` (regular expression) module.

## What It Does

- Opens a text file (`sample_emails.txt`)
- Uses a regex pattern to find email addresses
- Filters out duplicates using a Python `set`

- How to clean and deduplicate data using `set()`
- How to extract structured data from unstructured text
- How to handle file I/O safely
